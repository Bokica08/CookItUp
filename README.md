# CookItUp
Sorsix Final Project

Our project is an online recipe and grocery shopping platform that aims to simplify the cooking process for busy home cooks.
With our platform, users can browse a diverse selection of recipes, each with step-by-step instructions and a list of necessary ingredients. 
Our website is a mix between recipe browsing and grocery shopping. It's available for anyone and everywhere.
Users can easily order all the ingredients that are necessary to make a specific recipe.
